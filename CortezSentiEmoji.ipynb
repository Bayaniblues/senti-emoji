        "About 9 months ago I wanted to create a Alexa app. So I did a sentiment analysis of several skills in the amazon store, little did I know this was actually data science so I attempted to build a career out of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In my previous attempt at sentiment analysis, I divided parts of speech like Adjectives, Nouns, and verbs so I can find the combination that would best describe the strengths and weaknesses of certain Alexa skills. I learned that the User experience in Alexa skills is most important. With Alexa, there is a feature called account linking, that requires the user to sign in with their phone via the Alexa app. And seeing all these people complain specifically about account linking, from both positive and negative perspectives was an interesting experience for me. \n",
        "\n",
        "Amazon merchants have a lot of products and reviews to sort through, that is why classification can easily give merchants the ability to sort by sentiment, by review length, and by star rating. Merchants can use these filtering methods to compare unsavory reviews and improve their customer service, product offering, and conflict resolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Textblob has the ability to create new features and that is quite useful when there are not a lot of CSV columns to choose from. Text bob was built on top of NLTK, which makes natural language processing easy to work with. Textblob can extract Sentiment, Polarity, and subjectivity. Textblob can also extract parts of speech and offers a light translation API connecting to Google translate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The polarity is the emotion of the sentiment, a -1 polarity shows negative sentiment, a 0 polarity shows a neutral sentiment, and a 1 shows a positive sentiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The subjectivity shows how factual or objective a statement is. If the subjectivity is 0 then the phrase is stating a fact, if the subjectivity is 1 then the phrase is stating an opinion.\n",
        "\n",
        "In sentiment analysis, the target is always the polarity, because the polarity will pair with the review feature to finetune the existing classification model for transfer learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "We used a basic value counts to find the baseline of .79. Textblob also comes with its own linear and tree classifiers, this is the only way to transfer our models and minimize leakage. Our linear Naive Bayes model of .83 beats our baseline of .79, although the tree classification method is the same as baseline .79. Other methods outside this framework tend to overfit.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are interesting insights that we get from building classification models. For example, matching the total amount of star reviews to a product. Visualizing the sentiment analysis as pos, neu, neg. Finding the frequency of the available words looks very interesting as well. All these Visualizations can be plugged into a web app and used to post-process csv's for amazon merchants.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Model itself has a lot of use-cases, Textblob was originally trained off of Movie data, so finetuning eCommerce sentiment can have real-world application. Emojis were added just for fun. 😃\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, I built a simple app to process CSV files, the app has only two functions, analyze sentiment as a string, and make an analysis for the entire CSV. This was difficult to make something so simple becuase plotly dash seems to be more lower level than javascript, and creating custom react components requires us to make an NPM library and pip library? I had to help other people who had the this issue. I think that plotly dash might be easier if new users stick with plotly.go components. There is room for improvement for the plotly ecosystem, Probably by simplifying components as lambda functions so they are smaller And easier boilerplates for new users to get used to.\n"

The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.\",\n",

It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs.

Honestly I didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn't get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.\",\n",

In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.
